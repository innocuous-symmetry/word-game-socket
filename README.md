# Socket.io integration with React and Express

A bit of a patchwork solution to front/back end communications using socket.io. Still very early experimentation!

## Download and run locally

1. Clone the repo
2. run ``npm install`` in both client and server directories
3. run ``npm run dev`` in client directory
4. run ``npm start`` in server directory

The server terminal will log each new connection to the server
The client web page will display its socket ID once connected to the server
